Topics:

  1. layout and application creation
    layout:
      Header
      Sidebar
      Children
      Outlet
    
    School Management Application
      Pages:
        / or /students ---> students component ( Display the info for all students )
        /teachers --> teachers component ( Display the info for all teachers )
        /students/:stuId --> Student Component ( Display the info for a single student )
        /teachers/:teacherId --> Teacher Component ( Display the info for a single teacher )

  2. Props Drilling:
      passing props from parent to children
      Drilling of a particular or group of props to two or more levels of components

      Lot of re-renders at different levels

  3. Avoiding Props Drilling:

      Drilling of props from Parent --> Child --> GrandChild

      In Genereal, separate the props or state specific to the level( Component child/parent )
        Where You keep the ren-rendering controlled at particular level rather than rendering whole application

  4. Context:
    ** context is avoid the props drilling,but the entire application will re-render **

    ** Context should also be separated specific to the particulat levels to be re-rendering **

    Creation:
      Create a context using createContext
    
    Providing: 
      using Context.Provider 
    
    Consuming/Subscribing:
      using useContext

    useContext used to avoid props drilling but not the re-rendering

      context --> a base context for the entire application 
        or at particular component level

        hooks
          1. Create Context 
          2. useContext 
      
      Eg: theme --> light / dark theme for the entire application
          language --> language for the entire application
        
        Programming Language Selection on coding platform
      
      Provider: Provides the Context to the entire component tree
      Consume: useContext

      Advantage:
        Properties or state context on a grandparent component
        can be used by a grandchild with using a middle parent
      
      Disadvantage:
        Does not avoid the re-rendering of the child components
  
  6. Example: 
        Simple Light Theme Dark Theme
        Light / Theme Dark for E-Commerce Application

        Convert all the states to use context
